            Hi! My name is Ashmi Dasgupta. It was my first class of learning visual studio code and I was so excited. I can use it to make websites ans more and It has more advanced coding. If you are too feeling ecxited and wanting to try it, follow the steps  I am giving you. First download the app in your laptop,'Visual Studio code'. Then create a new folder in File explorer and give it a name. After that, go to Visual studio code and select the option New Floder in  the Files above. Select the folder that you have create in the file explorer. Now right click on the left most side and select  the New file option. Create three different files like this and name the first 'index.html', the second file 'style.css' and the last one 'main.js'. 
        Now, on the left most side you will find the extensions option. Click on it and search 'Live Server' and download it. Now you are all ready to lean and do your coding in Visual Studio code.       </p></h2>

       <h1>About console</h1>
       <h2><p>Now we have learned how to set Visual studio Code. Do you know about Console Screen? Well it is a screen which is mainly used to log information associated with a web page like: network requests, JavaScript, security errors, warnings, CSS etc. It enables us to interact with a web page by executing JavaScript expression in the contents of the page. For example create a var and name it as 'first name' and store it as 'Emma'. Then in the next line type 'console.log' and create tworound brackets and in it write variable name. Run the website or app.  after that right click and inspect and go to Console. You will see there written 'Emma' </p></h2>
